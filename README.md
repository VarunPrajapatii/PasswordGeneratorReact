# React + Vite

This project is a simple yet powerful random password generator tool designed to help users create strong and secure passwords. With increasing concerns about online security, having strong passwords is crucial to protect sensitive information. This tool generates passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring a high level of complexity and security.




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
